Thick vines strangled the peeling yellow shutters, parts of the roofline, and the terrace. A dilapidated tennis court sat behind, and there was a drained pool full of sand and empty gin bottles and tin cans."

First, the illuminating beam has been assumed to be perfectly monochromatic, whereas in reality there will be a spread of wavelengths of several parts per million; in addition, the wave incident on the specimen has been regarded as a uniform plane wave, which is equivalent to saying that it originated in an ideal ponint source."

It is one of the conveniences of all scanning systems that the signal that serves to generate the image is produced sequentially and can therefore be dispatched directly to computer memory for subsequent or on-line processing if required."

In the in-line methods, the reference wave is, of course, to be identified with the unscattered part of the main beam."

The simplest techniques, usually known as image enhancement, help to adapt the image to the visual response or to highlight features of particular interest."

Indeed, there are interesting specimens that cannot be directly observed at all, because they are destroyed by the electron dose that would be needed to form a discernible image."

Here, the aim is first to detect the structures, invisible to the unaided eye, and superimpose low-dose images of identical structures in such a way that the signal increases more rapidly than the noise and so gradually emerges from the surrounding fog."

Some statistical check must be applied to be sure that all the structures found are indeed the same and not members of distinct groups that bear a resemblance to one other but are not identical."
